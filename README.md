I'm making this app in order to strengthen my Jetpack Compose knowledge, by including:
  1. Push Notifications (Includes: Reminders to pray, the Athan, etc).
  2. Simple user customization that gets stored properly and safely in the user's device (Includes: Language, the Muathans voice, Light/Dark Mode).
  3. Gathering Athan timing via the Athan API and accurately presenting their cities data via gianing user access of their location.
  4. Pushing Error messages whenever an exception/error is thrown. 
  5. Using ViewModel, Stateflow and NavHost to make allow for a smooth experience while maintain the readability of the code.
